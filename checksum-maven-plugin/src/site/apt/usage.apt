* Initializing/Adding Checksums to the checksum file

  If you use the configuration above, you will have a generate-checksums 
  profile which will generate/update the checksums.txt file.  You will 
  typically do this when you first start using this plugin or you change 
  dependencies in the project.

+-----
mvn -P generate-checksums
+-----

* Validating Checksums

  Checksums get validated once the build hits the <<<validate>>> build phase.

+-----
mvn install
